## Project Description
Git-It-Done is a web app that uses GitHub's API to search for open-source projects with open issues and pull requests.

The project consists in adding the logic to retrieve and display GitHub repositories and their open issue counts when a user searches for them.

The user can search for repositories by username or by selecting the programming language of preference. The user can then click on a specific repo and the associated issues will be displayed. When clicking on a specific issue, a new tab will open the GitHub page of the issue.
